# Regression_Ordinary_least_squares_method
Problem Description: Karl Pearson conducted a survey around 1903 on the height of heights of fathers and their sons. The number of data points in the survey are 1078 samples. It is interesting to see whether son’s height can be predicted given father’s height. Hence a simple linear regression model can be built with the given data set. The objective of this project is to build the simple linear regression model using of libraries such as sklearn, numpy and matplotlib. The data set is given in the attached csv file named “father_son_heights.csv”
